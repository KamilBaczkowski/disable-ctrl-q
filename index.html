  <h1>Disable CTRL+Q</h1>
  <h2>on Firefox for Linux (and other browsers)</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, as of 2018-11-07, there does not seem to be an easy way to keep CTRL+Q from closing Firefox without warning under Linux, and most of the workarounds are unreliable or only work in certain circumstances.
    The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325692">corresponding bug</a> has been locked to prevent further comments, and then ignored for 4+ months, so it doesn't seem likely that this will be fixed soon.
    <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=243164">Unlike in Chrome</a>, I shall add (thank you, Chrome team!).
  </p>
  <p>
    As a consequence, every time you accidentally hit CTRL+Q, Firefox closes and you have to re-open it, wait for tabs to restore (and log in again everywhere if you discard cookies on exit).
  </p>
  <p>
    So I made this site. It can't completely disable the shortcut, but it will trigger a confirmation dialog so you can keep it from closing your entire browser.
    And hopefully motivate a Firefox developer into addressing this before the heat death of the universe. If this gets popular, maybe I'll add a global counter?

  <div id="inactive">
    <h2>Protection against CTRL+Q inactive!</h2>
    <p>To keep malicious web sites from abusing this, only web sites you have interacted with can show a warning before you close them. So, to disable CTRL+Q, you'll have to click this button:</p>
    <button onclick="activate()">Disable CTRL+Q</button>
  </div>
  <div id="active">
    Protection active.<br>
    I've saved you from this annoyance <span id="count">0</span> time(s).
  </div>
  <h2>This is stupid.</h2>
  <p>Yes.</p>

  <script>
    function activate() {
      document.getElementById('inactive').style.display = 'none';
      document.getElementById('active').style.display = 'block';

      let count = 0;
      window.onbeforeunload = function() {
        count++;
        document.getElementById('count').innerText = count;
        return 'Do you really want to close this site?';  // In case people use it in other browsers that support the text...
      }
    }
